# ITM618-Assignment2
This was an assignment for my Business Intelligence and Analytics class. We were asked to complete 4 tasks. 
1.) Divide the data into two sets. 80% as training data, and 20% as test data.
2.) Build a classification model based on the training data to predict if a new customer is 
approved or not.
3.) - Test the model on the test data and build the confusion matrix.
4.) Using the confusion matrix, calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall.
